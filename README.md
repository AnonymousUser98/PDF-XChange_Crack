# PDF-XChange Crack (BPS)
This is a crack for [PDF-XChange Editor](https://www.pdf-xchange.com/product/pdf-xchange-editor) and [PDF-Tools](https://www.pdf-xchange.com/product/pdf-tools) that unlocks all the paid features in the free version. This is legal even for commercial use (as long as you don't distribute the modified DLL file).

## How is it legal?
PDF-XChange Editor is copyrighted, so you might be wondering how this is legal. The answer is pretty simple: it's legal in the same way as ROM hacks for video games.
There is a DLL file that contains code for all the PDF editing features. It also contains data about which ones are free. Downloading a modified version of this DLL would be considered piracy. However, this repo doesn't contain the modified DLL file. It simply contains a BPS patch that contains all the differences between the original and modified DLL files. Because of this, downloading the patch is **not** considered piracy (because the patch file is not copyrighted). This is the exact same reason that makes ROM hacks legal; they don't contain the original ROM.

But wait - most modern computer programs have some kind of Terms & Conditions that you need to agree to. These almost always prevent you from doing stuff like this. However, while the PDF-XChange installer makes you agree, there is no ToS in the _portable_ version of the program (which completely bypasses the installer). This makes it perfectly legal to use the patch (even commercially), as long as you use the portable version of the program.

Note that there is no portable version of PDF-Tools, so using this crack with that program might be legally grey for commercial use.

## How To Use
Download the BPS patch file and apply it to `PDFXEditCore.x64.dll`. If you don't know how to do this, just go to [Rom Patcher JS](https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/) and select the original DLL file and the BPS file. After downloading the patched DLL file, just move it to the directory where PDF-XChange Editor is installed. You can either replace the original DLL file or rename it to `PDFXEditCore.x64.dll.old` (just make sure file name extensions are enabled).
